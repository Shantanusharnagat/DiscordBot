# Hello Astra!

This project includes a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) server script that uses a serverless [DataStax Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com/register) database. The app also includes a front-end with two web pages that connect to the database using the server API. üìä

The home page presents the user with a poll where they can choose an option, then the page presents the results in a chart. The admin page displays the log of past choices and allows the user to clear it by supplying their admin key (you can set this up by following the steps in `TODO.md`). üîí

## Prerequisites

To get best use out of this project you'll ideally be familiar with JavaScript and have a little Node.js experience‚Äìcheck out [Hello Node](https://glitch.com/~glitch-hello-node) if you haven't already!

## Setting up your Astra DB data

‚úèÔ∏è When you remix this project you'll need to provide your own Astra DB credentials and setup the database:

* [Sign up /into a DataStax Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=astra-glitch-react-express-starter).
* Click __Create Database__ &gt; __Get Started__.

![Database setup](https://cdn.glitch.com/ae313032-8fbd-4b72-bdc1-d5a86e415b34%2Fastra-db-setup.jpg?v=1623160620637)

* Enter your new database details:
  * __Database Name__ `Preferences`
  * __Keyspace Name__ `Coding`
  * Select a provider and region
  * Click __Create Database__

![Astra active](https://cdn.glitch.com/ae313032-8fbd-4b72-bdc1-d5a86e415b34%2Fastra-active.jpg?v=1623160649093)

* Once your database __Status__ changes to `Active` it's ready to use!

Connect your Astra DB data to your Glitch app:

![Astra ID](https://cdn.glitch.com/ae313032-8fbd-4b72-bdc1-d5a86e415b34%2Fastra-id.jpg?v=1623160673028)

* With your database selected, click __Connect__. Copy the `ASTRA_DB_ID` and region values, pasting them into your Glitch app `.env` as the corresponding variable values.

![Astra user](https://cdn.glitch.com/ae313032-8fbd-4b72-bdc1-d5a86e415b34%2Fastra-user-setup.jpg?v=1623160692336)

* Back in Astra, click the dropdown with your username displayed at the top left to access the __Organization Settings__.
* Select __Token Management__ and choose __Admin User__ from the dropdown list.
* Click __Generate Token__ and copy the `Token` value‚Äìpaste it into the Glitch `.env` as the `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` variable, and add your keyspace `Coding` for the other Astra variable.

Your database should be good to go and the app homepage should now present a poll with three options!

_You can also use the [GitHub Astra DB Starter Repository](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/glitch-astra-starter) which includes instructions for running locally._

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

‚Üê `.env`: The environment is cleared when you initially remix the project, but you will add a new env variable value when you follow the steps in `TODO.md` to set up an admin key.

### Server and database

‚Üê `server.js`: The Node.js server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site API. The API processes requests, connects to the database using the `astra` script in `src`, and sends info back to the client (the web pages that make up the app user interface, built using the Handlebars templates in `src/pages`).

‚Üê `/src/astra.js`: The database script handles setting up and connecting to Astra DB. The `server.js` API endpoints call the functions in the database script to manage the data.

### User interface

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The style rules that define the site appearance.

‚Üê `src/pages`: The handlebars files that make up the site user interface. The API in `server.js` sends data to these templates to include in the HTML.

‚Üê `src/pages/index.hbs`: The site homepage presents a form when the user first visits. When the visitor submits a preference through the form, the app calls the `POST` endpoint `/`, passing the user selection. The `server.js` endpoint updates the database and returns the user choices submitted so far, which the page presents in a chart (using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/)‚Äìyou can see the code in the page `head`);

‚Üê `src/pages/admin.hbs`: The admin page presents a table displaying the log of most recent picks. You can clear the list by setting up your admin key (see `TODO.md`). If the user attempts to clear the list without a valid key, the page will present the log again.

‚Üê `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

## Try this next üèóÔ∏è

Take a look in `TODO.md` for steps in setting up your admin key and adding to the site functionality.
